Fri Jun 15 2001 Markus Enzenberger <me@markus-enzenberger.de>

* NEWS,configure,configure.in: prepare for release 1.0.1
	
Mon May 14 2001 Markus Enzenberger <me@markus-enzenberger.de>

* src/client.c: fix bug in last changes that made Client_connect
  fail every time
	
Sat May 12 2001 Markus Enzenberger <me@markus-enzenberger.de>

* src/client.c: add testing for client.connected to some
  functions and let them return immediately FALSE if not true.

Thu May 10 2001 Markus Enzenberger <me@markus-enzenberger.de>

* src/server.c: fix bug: use correct STAT_NO_SUCH_ID instead of
  STAT_NO_SUCH_NUMB for unknown articles requested by message ID.
* src/client.c: fix bug: after a breakdown because of a timeout
  subsequent commands could have succeeded, but with
  server responses to previous commands.
	
Tue May 01 2001 Markus Enzenberger <me@markus-enzenberger.de>

* src/server.c: do not search all groups if group does not
  exist and contains no wildcards

Tue Mar 13 2001 Markus Enzenberger <me@markus-enzenberger.de>

 * src/client.c,NEWS: Fix bug. Server name was not yet initialized
   if server required authentication at connect time.

Wed Feb 28 2001 Markus Enzenberger <me@markus-enzenberger.de>

 * src/database.c: fix missing argument to snprintf

Tue Jan 30 2001 Jim Hague <jim.hague@acm.org)
 * README,INSTALL: A couple of minor updates to reflect the release of
   1.0.
	
Fri Dec 22 2000 Markus Enzenberger <me@markus-enzenberger.de>

 * configure.in: Change VERSION to 1.0 (and to 1.0develop after tagging),
   remove -DDEBUG from compiler options if enable-debug is not yes,
   because it turns on extensive logging.

 * TODO: Note that only bugfixes should be done in this CVS branch.

 * NEWS: Add section about release 1.0

Fri Dec 22 2000 Markus Enzenberger <markus.enzenberger@t-online.de>

 * AUTHORS: add Matija Nalis

Sun Dec 10 2000 Markus Enzenberger <markus.enzenberger@t-online.de>

 * src/client.c: Extract common code from putCmd and putCmdNoFlush,
   reset client.lastStat when sending new command

Thu Oxt 26 21:33:45 BST 2000 Jim Hague <jim.hague@acm.org>

 * src/protocol.c: Fix bug in Prt_getLn if we should read a line
   starting with '\0' - according to the leafnode mailing list,
   this has been seen in the wild.
	
Sun Oct 15 2000 Markus Enzenberger <markus.enzenberger@t-online.de>

 * acconfig.h,config.h.in,configure.in,src/Makefile.in,src/fetch.c:
   Applied patch by Paul Slootman: using the mail program is
   replaced by sendmail (SENDMAILPROG variable).

Sat Sep 02 2000 Markus Enzenberger <markus.enzenberger@t-online.de>

 * NEWS,src/client.c,src/protocol.c,src/protocol.h,src/server.c:
   Added timeout to Prt_getLn to avoid Noffle hanging if the
   connection breaks down during a fetch.

Sun Sep 10 2000 Markus Enzenberger <markus.enzenberger@t-online.de>

 * docs/NOTES: Added section about Gravity (thanks to
   Tomislav Filipcic <tfilip@jagor.srce.hr>).

Sat Sep 02 2000 Markus Enzenberger <markus.enzenberger@t-online.de>

 * src/client.c: use LIST instead of LIST ACTIVE, since it
   works with more news-servers.

Wed Aug 23 2000 Markus Enzenberger <markus.enzenberger@t-online.de>

 * src/server.c: do no longer always replace invalid message-IDs.

Fri Aug 11 2000 Markus Enzenberger <markus.enzenberger@t-online.de>

 * src/noffle.c: Minor bug fix. Noffle no longer tries to unsubscribe groups
   that are already unsubscribed.

Wed Jul 26 2000 Markus Enzenberger <markus.enzenberger@t-online.de>

 * Released version 1.0pre7

Tue Jul 25 2000 Markus Enzenberger <markus.enzenberger@t-online.de>

 * src/client.c: Added GMT to NEWGROUPS command.

Sat Jul 22 2000 Markus Enzenberger <markus.enzenberger@t-online.de>

 * doc/NOTES: Removed section about GNUS hanging. It was caused
   by the "select" bug in Noffle.

Sat Jul 22 2000 Markus Enzenberger <markus.enzenberger@t-online.de>

 * src/server.c, src/protocol.c: Fixed a critical bug. "select" cannot
   be used with buffered stdio. This caused Noffle to hang with some
   readers (like tin).
	
Mon Jul 17 11:19:06 BST 2000 Jim Hague <jim.hague@acm.org>

 * src/client.h,src/client.c,src/noffle.c,docs/noffle.1: Remove
   '--query times' option. Creation time should always be time of
   creation on local server.
 * src/group.h,src/group.c: Remove Grp_setCreated().
	
Fri Jul 14 15:20:14 BST 2000 Jim Hague <jim.hague@acm.org>

 * src/client.c,src/fetch.c,src/noffle.c: The groupinfo.lastupdate file
   was being used to (a) indicate the time of the last addition to group
   information, and (b) the last access to a server. With more than one
   server specified, (a) meant the groupinfo.lastupdate file was updated
   when new groups on the server (or a new fetch of the server group list)
   were processed. When server 2 came to use the file for (b) (to determine
   the time to specify when sending the NEWGROUPS command), the time was
   already set by server 1 and so server 2 would not see new groups. Fix
   this by creating lastupdate.<server> files for use (b).
 * src/client.c,src/group.c: Set initial group creation time to the current
   time. Previously it was set to 0, so new groups were not reported to a
   NEWGROUPS request unless 'noffle --query times' was run - even then,
   local groups would never be reported. Setting the creation time to the
   creation time on the local server makes things work properly. NB - the
   group creation time should always be reported as the creation time on
   the server; must fix this and remove '--query times'. This change will
   require 'noffle --query groups' to be re-run to create the server
   lastupdate.<server> files.

Tue Jul 12 12:54:01 BST 2000 Jim Hague <jim.hague@acm.org>

 * src/util.c: Fix Utl_rfc822Date to work properly in all timezones.

Mon Jul 03 12:05:50 BST 2000 Jim Hague <jim.hague@acm.org>

 * src/database.h,src/database.c,src/server.c: Fix 'XHDR <msgId>' and
   add 'XPAT <msgId>'. 'XHDR <msgId>' previously only worked if
   msgId was a message in the current group. My brain was really
   in neutral when I did that.

Sun Jun 25 09:45:50 BST 2000 Jim Hague <jim.hague@acm.org>

 * src/protocol.c: Another go at Prt_genMsgId. Yesterday I seeded the
   random element of the generated message id from the time; but what
   if two Noffle processes start in the same second? So switch to seeding
   with tv_usec instead.
	
Sat Jun 24 20:45:52 BST 2000 Jim Hague <jim.hague@acm.org>

 * src/noffle.c: Set last accessed time on group when subscribed
   from command line.
 * src/post.c: Bugfix - Post_close on duplicate article post.
 * src/server.c,docs/noffle.1: Redo posting. Check can post to all
   known groups before posting to any, permit post to moderated local
   groups if 'Approved:' header found, post to all servers for external
   groups instead of just first server.
  * src/protocol.c: Fix bug in Prt_genMsgId that caused duplicate
    message IDs to be generated for posts in the same second.

Mon Jun 19 22:43:38 BST 2000 Jim Hague <jim.hague@acm.org>

 * src/util.c, src/database.c: Fix header line reading bug.

Sat Jun 11 2000 Markus Enzenberger <markus.enzenberger@t-online.de>

 * Prepare for version 1.0pre6
 * configure.in: Removed warning options for warnings that are
   unavoidable with libgdbm

Sat Jun 03 2000 Markus Enzenberger <markus.enzenberger@t-online.de>

 * docs/NOTES: removed the whole section about the mail2news gateway.
   It doesn't really work, because procmail forks for each mail and
   changing the posting allowed status is not atomic.

Thu Jun 01 2000 Markus Enzenberger <markus.enzenberger@t-online.de>

 * docs/NOTES: Added section about "replace-messageid" option in
   the Mail-News-Gateway chapter.

Mon May 29 19:12:47 BST 2000 Jim Hague <jim.hague@acm.org>

 * src/client.c: Fix spelling mistake in comment.
 * docs/noffle.1: Add a little bit more to the description of --online.
	
Mon May 29 18:48:39 CEST 2000 Uwe Hermann <uh1763@bingo-ev.de>

 * configure, configure.in: Changed the --enable-debug option of configure.
   It now accepts the parameters 'no', 'min' and 'yes', i.e. no compiler-
   warnings, minimum compiler-warnings and maximum compiler-warnings.
   Default is 'min'. Stable releases should have 'no' as default, IHMO.

 * NEWS: Update.

Fri May 26 11:38:27 BST 2000 Jim Hague <jim.hague@acm.org>

 * docs/NOTES: Added notes on knode.
 * src/client.c: Corrected comment.
	
Sat May 20 22:17:48 CEST 2000 Uwe Hermann <uh1763@bingo-ev.de>

 * docs/Makefile.am, docs/Makefile.in: Added INTERNALS to docs/Makefile.am, so
   that it is included in the distribution by 'make distcheck'.

 * docs/NOTES: Added info about pan versions 0.7.6 and 0.8

Sat May 20 2000 Markus Enzenberger <markus.enzenberger@t-online.de>
 * src/noffle.c: always enable generation of core files.

Fri May 19 14:02:44 BST 2000 Jim Hague <jim.hague@acm.org>

 * src/content.c: Ensure if last article(s) in group are cancelled that
   article numbers aren't re-used.
 * src/util.c: Redo Utl_rfc822Date to not use strftime - this was potentially
   wrong as it would only generate a conformant date string in
   English locales.
 * docs/INTERNALS: Move INTERNALS to docs/.

Thu May 18 13:22:36 BST 2000  Jim Hague <jim.hague@acm.org>

 * Recognise explicit posting statuses of 'y', 'n' and 'the rest'.
   The latest IETF draft says you can have other statuses apart from
   'm' (moderated group), and these should probably be treated in the
   same way as 'm', i.e. forwarded to the external server to worry
   about.
	
Wed May 17 2000 Markus Enzenberger <markus.enzenberger@t-online.de>

 * README: Clean-up and update.
 * docs/noffle.conf.5, src/configfile.h, src/server.c:
   Disabled remove-msgid option.

Sun May 14 16:51:24 BST 2000 Jim Hague <jim.hague@acm.org>

 * docs/NOTES: Added notes on trn, xrn and knews.
 * src/configfile.h, src.configfile.c, src/server.c, docs/noffle.conf.5:
   Increment the article number of the gen info article in groups that
   are not auto-subscribed each time the gen info article is read. The gen
   info article thus remains unread at the start of every newsreading
   session. This behaviour can be disabled by setting new config
   setting 'info-always-unread' to 'no'. Default is 'yes'. This (I hope)
   restores Markus's preferred behaviour.
 * INTERNALS: Added file with some rough jottings on the internals of Noffle.
   A work in (probably sporadic) progress.

Sun May 14 2000 Markus Enzenberger <markus.enzenberger@t-online.de>

 * src/fetch.c: Did some refactoring.

Sat May 13 15:09:01 BST 2000 Jim Hague <jim.hague@acm.org>

 * src/itemlist.c: Fixed stupid, Stupid, STUPID bug in Itl_next().
   Redid itemlist code slightly to remove need to keep separators
   string, at the cost of making it impossible to use '\1' as a
   separator. I don't think this will be a problem.
 * src/log.h, src/log.c, src/over.h, src/over.c: Adjusted consting
   in Log_init and new_Over to remove compiler warnings.
 * src/portable.h, src/server.c, src/client.c: Introduced UNUSED(x)
   macro to indicate deliberately unused function parameters and
   remove warnings.
 * src/content.c: Preserve gen info in Cont_write() provided it is
   followed by an article with the next number. Stops gen info article
   vanishing instantly on reading when auto-subscribe is on, which
   was sort-of confusing for users (why can't I read that again?)
   and caused xrn to complain the NNTP server was broken.

Sat May 13 2000 Markus Enzenberger <markus.enzenberger@t-online.de>

 * src/client.c: Rewrote needsMark(): uses itemlist.h, more debugging output.
 * src/server.c: Rewrote getTimesInSeconds(): arguments ar now int and
   checked with assertions. Return value is time_t and must be checked
   for (time_t)-1.

Sat May 13 06:20:01 CEST 2000 Uwe Hermann <uh1763@bingo-ev.de>

 * src/Makefile.am, src/Makefile.in: Added portable.h to the list of sources.
   I forgot this in my last commit. Sorry.

Fri May 12 2000 Markus Enzenberger <markus.enzenberger@t-online.de>

 * src/client.c: add some intermediate variables for easier debugging
   in needsMark(). It seems that thread mode is sometimes not working.
 * src/client.c, src/content.c, src/dynamicstring.h, src/dynamicstring.c,
   src/util.h, src/util.c, src/protocol.c:
   Changed some variable types and used some casts to avoid compiler
   warnings about signedness. In general, int should be used for parameters
   for allowing a signedness assertion in the function.
   (see J.Lakos: Large-Scale C++ Software Design, section 9.2).
 * src/client.c, src/database.c, src/database.h, src/fetch.c, src/fetchlist.c,
   src/fetchlist.h, src/group.c, src/group.h, src/noffle.c, src/server.c
   src/server.h:
   Renamed some variables, because they caused compiler warnings because
   of shadowing global variables from system include files
   (index, stat, serv).
 * src/fetchlist.c:
   Avoid compiler warning because of cast from const to non-const.
 * src/post.c, src/server.c:
   Avoid compiler warnings about incomplete initializer blocks.
	
Fri May 12 10:19:56 CEST 2000  Uwe Hermann <uh1763@bingo-ev.de>

 * configure, configure.in: Only add all those compiler-switches
   like -ansi, -pedantic etc. if we use gcc. Other c-compilers are unlikely
   to have those switches.


Wed May 10 00:25:44 CEST 2000  Uwe Hermann <uh1763@bingo-ev.de>

 * src/client.c, src/configfile.c, src/content.c, src/control.c,
   src/database.c, src/dynamicstring.c, src/fetch.c, src/fetchlist.c,
   src/group.c, src/itemlist.c, src/lock.c, src/log.c, src/noffle.c,
   src/online.c, src/outgoing.c, src/over.c, src/post.c, src/protocol.c,
   src/pseudo.c, src/request.c, src/server.c, src/util.c:
   Added portable.h #include.

 * src/client.h, src/database.h, src/fetch.c, src/group.h, src/lock.c,
   src/outgoing.c, src/over.c, src/over.h, src/pseudo.c, src/server.c,
   src/util.c, src/util.h: Added some #ifdefs to correctly include either
   time.h or sys/time.h or both, depending on which are found.

 * src/noffle.c: Changed the return-type of the signal-handlers bugReport()
   and logSignal() to RETSIGTYPE, which is either void or int, depending on
   the system you compile on (autoconf #defines the RETSIGTYPE).

 * src/portable.h: Added file. This #defines some macros, so the code uses
   __snprintf() and __vsnprintf if snprintf and vsnprintf aren't available.
   This is the case on SunOS, for example.


Sat May  6 12:25:39 BST 2000  Jim Hague <jim.hague@acm.org>

 * src/server.c: Changed XOVER with no arg. to return info for current
   article, not error.

 * src/server.c, src/content.h, src/content.c: XHDR - added 'xref' to
   headers recognised to keep trn happy, and recognise message ID argument.

 * src/server.c, src/content.c: Ensure first/last from LIST ACTIVE and
   GROUP agree (trn uses former). Tricky with pseudo gen info articles
   around. Presence of these now only recorded in content and not
   reflected in group first/last until proper article posted after
   pseudo.

 * src/client.c, NEWS: Reinstated starting article numbering from first
   article number on server. Reasoning below is wrong except in exceptional
   circumstances (e.g. join group, auto-subscribe, manual unsubscribe,
   auto subscribe again, etc. to get > 2 Noffle info messages in group.
   Bring reader up to date, remove & reinstall Noffle. Join group,
   autosubscribe after more news arrives at server, reader thinks it has read
   n articles it hasn't, where n is number of Noffle info messages in
   group first time round - 2). Feature is generally useful, esp. in
   development, so back in it goes.

 * src/group.c: Forget cached group info when group database closed.
	

Sat May  6 01:31:04 CEST 2000  Uwe Hermann <uh1763@bingo-ev.de>

 * Makefile.in, configure, configure.in, docs/Makefile.in, src/Makefile.in:
   Added checks for the mail and sort programs. ./configure will abort if
   they're not found.

 * README: Removed the paragraph about news client software, as it's the same
   as the one in docs/NOTES.

 * TODO: Removed 'expiring by groups' and
   'move some text from noffle.1 to noffle.conf.5'.

 * docs/NOTES: Changed the text about -DDEBUG to explain one should use
   './configure --enable-debug'.

 * docs/noffle.1, docs/noffle.conf.5: Minor fixes. Added myself and Jim Hague
   to the AUTHORS section :-)

 * src/client.h, src/common.h, src/configfile.h, src/content.c, src/content.h,
   src/control.c, src/control.h, src/database.h, src/dynamicstring.c,

   src/post.h, src/protocol.h, src/pseudo.h, src/request.h, src/server.h,
   src/util.c, src/util.h: Added the <config.h> include.

 * src/content.c: Added missing include "content.h". Added a missing 'void'
   in the declaration of clearCont().

 * src/fetchlist.c: Casted fetchlist.size to (size_t) in a call to qsort(),
   as qsort() expects a size_t. This removes a warning.

 * src/noffle.c: Made doRequested() static. Added missing void to
   enableCorefiles().

 * src/log.c, src/protocol.c, src/online.c, src/pseudo.c: Added missing
   includes.

 * src/pseudo.c: Made genOv() and genPseudo() static.

 * src/server.c: Added missing void to postArts(). Made touchArticle() static.

 * src/util.c: Casted arguments of malloc() and memcpy() to size_t.

 * src/dynamicstring.c, src/itemlist.c, src/over.c, src/request.c, src/util.c: 
   Removed casting of the result of malloc(). This is not necessary and
   can hide a missing include of <stdlib.h>.

   src/protocol.c, src/request.c, src/server.c: Files now #include <config.h>.
   Added missing <stdio.h>. This removes the warnings about snprintf() not
   being declared.

 * Makefile: Removed. This is now generated by configure.

 * AUTHORS, COPYING, ChangeLog, README, INSTALL, NEWS, docs/FAQ, docs/NOTES:
   Added files.

 * TODO.TXT: Renamed to TODO. Slightly changed formatting.

 * README: Reformatted the file. Added info about CVS. Added a pointer to
   the file INSTALL.

 * noffle.1, noffle.conf.5: Moved to docs/

 * LSM.TXT: Moved to docs/noffle.lsm. Small fix.

 * INSTALL: Adapted to autoconf build-system. A few minor fixes.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.0pre6pre

     * Forget cached group info when group database closed.
     * Added list of 'forbidden' newsgroup specs., as defined in draft IETF
       Newsgroup Format (C.Lindsey), tracked to replace RFC1036. This defines
       newsgroup names that should only be used for server-local groups and
       server pseudo-groups (e.g. INN's to.*, cancel, cancel.*, junk). These
       are now intercepted when querying server groups and ignored. Group names
       omitted are any single component names, any 'control.*', 'to' or
       'to.*',and any with a component 'all' or 'ctl'.
       Note these restrictions do not apply to local group names.
     * Fixed problem with article numbering if the overview file empties,
       e.g. due to all articles in a very low volume group expiring. This
       would cause article numbers to be set back to 1 when a new article
       arrives.
     * Changed %i to %d in sscanfs everywhere. INN often (as it is entitled
       to do) has leading zeros on numbers. %i interprets these as octal
       numbers. Also changed %i to %d in printfs, for no good reason.
     * New groups now always start numbering at article 1. Previously article
       numbering would start with the first held remote article number, in an
       attempt to avoid newsreaders noticing if noffle is deleted and
       reinstalled. Given Noffle may well not collect the first held article
       anyway - it only will if the default number of articles to retrieve on
       a first connect is big enough - and the fact that Noffle's pseudo
       articles make it impossible to keep local article numbers in lock-step
       with the server, there is the chance this scheme would just cause
       readers to miss new articles.
     * Record newsgroup posting status. Enforce it at posting time.
       Added --modify to change newsgroup descriptions for all groups and
       posting status for local groups.
     * Added group deletion.
     * Added message cancellation - from command line or by control message.
       Note command line only cancels locally - it can't be used to cancel a
       message that has already gone offsite. A control messages cancels
       locally if possible; it is only propaged offsite if the target is in a
       non-local group and has itself already gone offsite.
     * Added wildmat code taken from INN - ensure Noffle wildcarding is
       exactly to spec.
     * Added group-specific expire times.
     * Noffle now sends a "MODE READER" command after connecting to the
       remote server. INN needs this before it will permit POST.
     * Applied patch from Jim Hague: support for local groups / new command
       line options --create and --cancel.
     * Changed output of 'noffle -a all' to standard mailbox format,
       so that tools like grepmail work.

Version 1.0pre5

     * Core files are always enabled when running as server and debugging
       symbols are always in the executable.
     * Use GDBM_FAST flag for hash files.
     * Fixed a bug in online mode with servers that need authentication.
     * Minor changes and improvements

Version 1.0pre4

     * Fixed a bug that broke cross-posting of articles
     * Fixed a bug that truncated headers of posted articles.
     * Long overview header lines are now split into multiple lines in
       response to HEAD or ARTICLE commands.
     * Fixed a bug that caused a crash sometimes when updating the
       requested article list after releasing/regetting the global lock
     * Server is now allowed to generate core files on crash (in spool
       directory) if compiled with -DDEBUG option
     * Opening an article additionally marks all references as
       interesting, so more articles are fetched in thread mode, if one
       article of a thread was opened.
     * New config option "connect-timeout"
     * Minor improvements and bug-fixes

     * Added XPAT command. Not full syntax, but enough for making slrn's
       thread reconstruction work
     * Storing of requested message-ids completely rewritten (thanks to
       Volker Wysk for the patch). Much more efficient now. Bug removed
       that broke requesting articles with message-IDs containing a
       slash. Added --requested option.

       commands at once, before parsing the server response.
     * Minor bug fixes and improvements.
