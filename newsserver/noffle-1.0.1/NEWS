NOFFLE NEWS -- User visible changes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.0.1
-----

 * Released on 15 Jun 2001
 * Fixed bug that broke authentication if the server required it at
   connect time.
 * Fix bug that made Noffle to get server responses to wrong commands,
   after a read timeout occurred and could lead to mixed up group
   contents and messages.
 * minor optimizations and fixes

1.0:
----

 * Released on 27 Jan 2001.
 * In the 1.0pre8 release, debug logging was enabled in the standard
   settings, which slowed down Noffle considerably. it is disabled by
   default now.

1.0pre8:
--------

 * Noffle no longer hangs if the connection breaks down during a fetch.
 * SENDMAILPROG is used instead of mail for returning failed postings.

1.0pre7:
--------

 * Fixed a bug that caused noffle to hang with some readers (like tin/Gnus).
 * Fix bug with time of last server access for setups with multiple servers.
   You must re-run 'noffle --query groups'.
 * Remove '--query times'.
 * Fix date printing bug. Now works in all(?) timezones.
 * Fix bug with 'XHDR <msgId>'. Add 'XPAT <msgId>'.
 * Allow post to local moderated group if 'Approved:' header present.

1.0pre6
-------
11 June 2000

 * added ./configure-option '--enable-debug=[no/min/yes]'
 * Add 'info-always-unread' option.
 * Add support for XOVER with no argument. Also XHDR with message ID
   argument and XHDR when 'xref' requested (trn needs this).
 * Forget cached group info when group database closed.
 * Added list of 'forbidden' newsgroup specs., as defined in draft IETF
   Newsgroup Format (C.Lindsey), tracked to replace RFC1036. This defines
   newsgroup names that should only be used for server-local groups and
   server pseudo-groups (e.g. INN's to.*, cancel, cancel.*, junk). These
   are now intercepted when querying server groups and ignored. Group names
   omitted are any single component names, any 'control.*', 'to' or
   'to.*',and any with a component 'all' or 'ctl'.
   Note these restrictions do not apply to local group names.
 * Fixed problem with article numbering if the overview file empties,
   e.g. due to all articles in a very low volume group expiring. This
   would cause article numbers to be set back to 1 when a new article
   arrives.
 * Record newsgroup posting status. Enforce it at posting time.
   Added --modify to change newsgroup descriptions for all groups and
   posting status for local groups.
 * Added group deletion.
 * Added message cancellation - from command line or by control message.
   Note command line only cancels locally - it can't be used to cancel a
   message that has already gone offsite. A control messages cancels
   locally if possible; it is only propaged offsite if the target is in a
   non-local group and has itself already gone offsite.
 * Added wildmat code taken from INN - ensure Noffle wildcarding is
   exactly to spec.
 * Added group-specific expire times.
 * Noffle now sends a "MODE READER" command after connecting to the
   remote server. INN needs this before it will permit POST.
 * added support for local groups
 * new command line options --create and --cancel
 * Changed output of 'noffle -a all' to standard mailbox format,
   so that tools like grepmail work.
 * documentation updates
 * NOFFLE now uses the autoconf/automake build-system
